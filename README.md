# Generative AI GANs

Welcome to the GANs Playground! This repository is a showcase of the exciting work I undertook during my internship, where I had the opportunity to implement and explore the captivating world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their innovative cousins: Pix2Pix, Conditional GANs (cGANs), and CycleGAN. These models allowed me to generate novel data samples, perform intricate image-to-image translations, and dive deep into the realm of generative AI.

# Overview

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs represent a class of machine learning models that engage in a captivating game-like interplay between a generator and a discriminator. The generator strives to craft data that is virtually indistinguishable from genuine data, while the discriminator's mission is to distinguish between real and synthetic data. This dynamic results in the creation of exceptionally realistic synthetic data.

- **Conditional GANs (cGANs)**: These enhanced GANs introduce the concept of conditional information. cGANs are proficient at generating data based on specific conditions or labels. For example, they can generate images of handwritten digits (MNIST) based on a specified digit.

- **Pix2Pix**: Pix2Pix is an exciting technique that facilitates image-to-image translation. It excels in transforming input images from one domain into corresponding images in another domain. Its applications range from converting sketches into lifelike images to turning satellite imagery into maps.


- **CycleGAN**: CycleGAN stands out as a versatile model capable of style transfer and domain adaptation. It excels in translating images between two domains while maintaining essential characteristics. Its capabilities extend from altering the style of images (e.g., transforming a horse into a zebra) to adapting images from one domain to another (e.g., transmuting an apple into an orange).
